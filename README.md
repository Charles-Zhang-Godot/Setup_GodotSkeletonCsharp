# Godot Runtime Animation Import

(Was originally planning to do it in C# but ended doing it in GDscript directly)

A demo setup of importing and using glb files during runtime with animation.

Notice the skeletal mesh + skeleton is created in Blender (4.3), with IK constraints and animations baked during export.
The IK animation (with empty object) serve as controller while the armature animation is baked during glb export.
